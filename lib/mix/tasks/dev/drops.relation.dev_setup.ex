    Sets up the development environment for Drops.

    This task ensures that the test support files are loaded and the development
    environment is properly configured for running examples and ecto tasks.

    ## Usage

        mix drops.dev.setup

    This task is automatically called by other development tasks like ecto commands
    and example runners, so you typically don't need to run it manually.

    ## What it does

    - Loads test/support/setup.ex which contains all necessary setup
    - Ensures dependencies are started
    - Sets up the test repository for development use
    - Configures the environment for examples and database operations
